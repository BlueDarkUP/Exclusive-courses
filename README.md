# üöÄ Exclusive Courses: A Journey into Robotics and AI Engineering

Welcome to the exclusive learning repository curated by **Jiang (BlueDarkUP)** for FTC Team 27570 and the broader robotics community.

This is not just a collection of code snippets; it's a **structured learning path** designed to take you from a novice programmer to a confident systems engineer. Each course, built upon real-world competition projects, represents a step forward in technical skill and, more importantly, in engineering thinking.

## üí° Core Philosophy

This curriculum is built on three core principles:

> **1. Beyond Just Code: Understanding the "Why"**
> We don't just write code; we solve problems. These courses focus on the design patterns, architectural decisions, and engineering trade-offs behind every line of code.

> **2. From Prototype to Product: An Evolutionary Approach**
> Witness the evolution of a system from a single, all-in-one script to a modular, robust, and maintainable API. This is how real-world software is built.

> **3. Building Tools, Not Just Solutions**
> The ultimate goal of a senior engineer is not just to build a solution for one problem, but to build tools that empower others to solve many problems. This curriculum culminates in the creation of powerful, reusable development tools.

## üìö The Curriculum: From Novice to Architect

The seven courses are designed to be followed in order, building upon the concepts learned in the previous stage.

### Part I: Foundations of FTC Robotics - Mastering TeleOp

This section is for anyone new to FTC Java programming. We start with the basics of controlling a robot and introduce the fundamental concepts of software structure.

#### üéì **Course 1: Your First Competition-Ready TeleOp**
- **What you'll learn:** The fundamental structure of a `LinearOpMode`, how to map hardware, and implement robust driver controls for a Mecanum drive base.
- **Key Concepts:** Hardware Mapping, Field-Centric Drive, State Machines, Debouncing.
- ‚û°Ô∏è **[Access the Course on Notion](https://grizzly-treatment-ac4.notion.site/FTC-27570-TeleOp-250969a5284d8075b144dca6f421e9b8?pvs=73)**

#### üîß **Course 2: Advanced TeleOp with Road Runner Integration**
- **What you'll learn:** How to integrate a sophisticated motion planning library (Road Runner) into your TeleOp for powerful, semi-autonomous actions like "one-click return to a saved position."
- **Key Concepts:** Road Runner API, `Pose2d`, Action Sequences, Position Memory.
- ‚û°Ô∏è **[Access the Course on Notion](https://grizzly-treatment-ac4.notion.site/FTC-27570-250969a5284d8098bb35c9c637ac0fa3?pvs=73)**

### Part II: The Leap to Intelligent Systems - Vision APIs

Here, we move beyond simple control and begin to give our robot "eyes." You will learn how to build and consume powerful, reusable vision APIs.

#### üß† **Course 3: Building a Vision API (The Journey Begins)**
- **What you'll learn:** An introduction to designing a self-contained vision system. This course covers the initial architecture for a vision pipeline that can be used by any OpMode.
- **Key Concepts:** API Design (Facade Pattern), `OpenCvPipeline`, Color Segmentation, Contour Analysis.
- ‚û°Ô∏è **[Access the Course on Notion](https://grizzly-treatment-ac4.notion.site/FTC-27570-API-250969a5284d8039bb4ee5f524f3279f?pvs=73)**

#### ‚ú® **Course 4: Architecting a Production-Grade Vision System**
- **What you'll learn:** A masterclass in software architecture. This course refactors the initial API into a highly modular, maintainable, and powerful system with clear separation of concerns, culminating in the final version used in the `INTO THE DEEP` season.
- **Key Concepts:** Separation of Concerns (SoC), Configuration Management (`VisionConstants`), Advanced Decision Logic (`DetectionProcessor`), Physics & Kinematics Modeling (`GraspingCalculator`).
- ‚û°Ô∏è **[Access the Course on Notion](https://grizzly-treatment-ac4.notion.site/FTC-27570-API-250969a5284d808380a8ea220da47436?pvs=73)**

### Part III: End-to-End AI Projects - From Pixels to Action

This section dives deep into complete, standalone AI projects. You will learn to build systems that perceive, think, and act entirely on their own.

#### üåä **Course 5: Case Study - The FLL AquaHunter (Autonomous ROV)**
- **What you'll learn:** How to build a complete, single-script AI system from scratch. This project covers real-time object tracking with the SORT algorithm and visual servoing for an underwater robot.
- **Key Concepts:** `YOLOv8` Inference, **SORT Algorithm (Kalman Filter + Hungarian Algorithm)**, Hardware Abstraction Layers (HAL), Serial Communication.
- ‚û°Ô∏è **[Access the Course on Notion](https://grizzly-treatment-ac4.notion.site/FTC-27570-250969a5284d802eabe6de3f2173870d?pvs=73)**

### Part IV: The Masterclass - Building the Tools for AI

This final section represents the pinnacle of engineering: instead of just *using* AI, you will learn how to build the **professional tools and pipelines** that *enable* AI development.

#### üõ†Ô∏è **Course 6: Building Your Own Data Engine - Zero-to-YOLO-Yard**
- **What you'll learn:** How to architect and build a full-stack web application for managing the entire machine learning data lifecycle. This is a deep dive into creating a local, powerful alternative to cloud-based annotation platforms.
- **Key Concepts:** `Flask` Web Framework, `SQLite` Database Design, REST APIs, Asynchronous Tasks, **SAM 2.1 Integration**, Frontend Development (`JavaScript`, `jQuery`).
